The main database for structual data is called the PDB (Protein Data Bank). Let's see what it contains:

Data from: https://www.rcsb.org/stats

```{r}
pdbdb <- read.csv("pdb_stats.csv")
pdbdb
```

```{r}
pdbdb$Total
```

I need to remove the comma and convert to numeric to do math:
```{r}
as.numeric(sub(",","",pdbdb$Total))
#as.numeric(pdbdb$Total)
```
I could turn this inot a function to fix the whole table or any future table I read like this: 

```{r}
x <- pdbdb$Total
as.numeric(sub(",","",x))
```
```{r}
comma2numeric <- function(x){
  as.numeric(sub(",","",x))
}
```

```{r}
comma2numeric(pdbdb$X.ray)
```
```{r}
apply(pdbdb, 2, comma2numeric)
```

## Or try a different read/import function: 

```{r}
library(readr)
pdbdb <- read_csv("pdb_stats.csv")
```
```{r}
sum(pdbdb$Total)
```

>. Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$`X-ray`)/sum(pdbdb$Total)*100
```
x-Ray = 83.30359%

```{r}
sum(pdbdb$`EM`)/sum(pdbdb$Total)*100
```
EM = 10.18091%

>. Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
pdbdb$Total[1]/sum(pdbdb$Total)*100
```

>. Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

Currently, there are 5 HIV-1 protease structures in the PDB.

## Mol*

Mol* (pronounced "molstar") is a new web-based molecular viewer that we will need to learn the basics of here. 

https://molstar.org/viewer/

We will use PDB code: 1HSG

>. Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

We see just one atom per water molecule because it allows us to focus on the main structural features of the molecule

>. Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

This water molecule has a residue number 308. 

>. Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

## The Bio3D

The bio3d package allows us to do all sorts of structural bioinformations work in R.

Let's start with ohw it can read these PDB files 

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(pdb)
```
>. Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
length(pdbseq(pdb))
```
>. Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 

HOH and MK1

>. Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

2

```{r}
unique(pdb$atom$chain)
```

## Prediciting functional motions of a single strucutre 

Let's do a bioinformatics prediction of function motions - i.e the movements that one of these molecules needs to make to do its stuff 

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
# Perform flexibility prediction
m <- nma(adk)

plot(m)
```

Write out multi-model PDB file that we can use to make an animation of the predicted motions.

```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk.pdb")
```


## Comparative Analysis of protein strucutres 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

Here we will find and analyze all ADK structures in the PDB database. 

We will start with a single database accession id: "1ake_A"

```{r}
id <- "1ake_A"
aa <- get.seq(id)
aa
```

>. Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN?

msa package

>. Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

bio3d

>. Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

True

>. Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

```{r}
ncol(aa$al)
```


```{r}
attributes(aa)
```

```{r}
b <- blast.pdb(aa)
```
```{r}
plot(b)
```


```{r}
hits <- NULL
hits$pdb.id <- c('1AKE_A','6S36_A','6RZE_A','3HPR_A','1E4V_A','5EJE_A','1E4Y_A','3X2S_A','6HAP_A','6HAM_A','4K46_A','3GMT_A','4PZL_A')
```

```{r}
# Download releated PDB files
files <- get.pdb(hits$pdb.id, path="pdbs", split=TRUE, gzip=TRUE)
```

Next we will use the pdbaln() function to align and also optionally fit (i.e. superpose) the identified PDB structures.

```{r}
# Align releated PDBs
pdbs <- pdbaln(files, fit = TRUE, exefile="msa")
```
```{r}
pdb
```

## Principle Component Analysis 

```{r}
# Perform PCA
pc.xray <- pca(pdbs)
plot(pc.xray)
```

To visualize the major structural variations in the ensemble the function mktrj() can be used to generate a trajectory PDB file by interpolating along a give PC (eigenvector):

```{r}
pc1 <- mktrj(pc.xray, pc=1, file="pc_1.pdb")
```
