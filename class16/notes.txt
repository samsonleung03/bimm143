Q. How many sequences are in this mouse.1.protein.faa file? Hint: Try using grep to figure this out…

3 protein sequences

Q. What happens if you run the above command without the > mm-first.fa part?

It returns the seqeunces for that mouse 1 protein

Q. What happens if you were to use two ‘>’ symbols (i.e. >> mm-first.fa)?


blastp -query mm-first.fa -db zebrafish.1.protein.faa

scp -i "bimm143_saleung.pem" ubuntu@ec2-35-86-246-74.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/work/mm-second.x.zebrafish.tsv myresult.rsv
